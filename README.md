**Project Overview**: **Student Grade Tracker**
**Purpose**:
The purpose of this project is to create a Python program that allows users to input grades for different subjects or assignments, calculate the average grade, and display additional information such as letter grades and GPA based on a standard grading scale.

**Key Components and Functions**:

**Functions for Calculation:**

calculate_average(grades): Computes the average grade from a list of grades provided.
calculate_letter_grade(average_grade): Determines the letter grade corresponding to the average grade based on a standard grading scale (A, B, C, D, F).
calculate_gpa(average_grade): Converts the average grade to GPA based on a 4.0 scale commonly used in many educational systems.

**Main Program Execution**:

Initialization: Starts by welcoming the user to the Student Grade Tracker.
Input Loop: Continuously prompts the user to enter grades until they type "done". Each grade entered is validated to ensure it falls within the range of 0 to 100.
Grade Calculation: After input ends, calculates the average grade using calculate_average() and displays it.
Additional Information: Calculates and displays the corresponding letter grade using calculate_letter_grade() and the GPA using calculate_gpa().

**Error Handling**:

Ensures input validation for grades to prevent invalid entries.
Provides informative messages for invalid inputs and prompts users to retry entering correct values.
**User Interaction**:

Offers a user-friendly interface where users can interactively input grades and receive immediate feedback on the average grade, letter grade, and GPA.

**Features**:

Flexible Input: Allows users to input grades until they decide to finish, accommodating varying numbers of grades.
Comprehensive Analysis: Computes not only the average grade but also provides additional insights such as letter grade and GPA, enhancing the usefulness of the program for educational tracking.

**Educational Use:**
Provides a practical example of using functions, loops, input validation, and conditional logic in Python programming, making it suitable for learning purposes.
